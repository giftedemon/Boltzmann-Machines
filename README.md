# Boltzmann-Machines

## Introduction

Boltzmann Machines are a type of stochastic recurrent neural network. They are used to solve difficult combinatorial problems and to model probability distributions over complex datasets.

## Types of Boltzmann Machines

1. **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)**: A simplified version of Boltzmann Machines with a bipartite structure, consisting of visible and hidden units.
2. **Deep Belief Networks (DBN)**: A stack of RBMs where each RBM layer communicates with both the previous and the next layers.

## Applications

-   Dimensionality reduction
-   Classification
-   Regression
-   Collaborative filtering
-   Feature learning

## How They Work

Boltzmann Machines learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs. They use a process called Gibbs sampling to update the weights and biases of the network to minimize the energy of the system.

## Training

Training Boltzmann Machines involves adjusting the weights to minimize the difference between the input data distribution and the distribution represented by the model. This is typically done using gradient-based optimization techniques.
